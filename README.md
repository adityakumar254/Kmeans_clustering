# 🔍 K-Means Clustering

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **K-Means Clustering**, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning datasets into distinct clusters based on similarity. The project explores its application on various datasets to uncover hidden patterns and insights.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand and visualize how K-Means Clustering groups data points.
- Apply clustering to real-world datasets.
- Analyze the optimal number of clusters using techniques like the Elbow Method.

## 📂 Dataset
This project uses [provide dataset details, e.g., a custom dataset or a public dataset from sources like UCI, Kaggle, etc.].

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
  - **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - **Clustering**: Scikit-learn

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values and clean the dataset.
   - Scale the features for optimal clustering performance.
2. **Clustering**:
   - Apply K-Means Clustering to group data points.
   - Experiment with different values of `K` (number of clusters).
3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Use metrics like Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) to evaluate clusters.
   - Visualize clusters using scatter plots and other tools.
4. **Insights and Analysis**:
   - Interpret the clusters and derive meaningful patterns.
